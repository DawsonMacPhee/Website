            <p>Welcome to my website! I am a Honours Co-op Computer Science major at the University of Guelph and
                this is a collection of projects and information about me and my journey in 
                the technology industry. This site is meant to complement my resume and provide more 
                information and examples of my skills to potential employers. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="subtitle">About Me</h1>
            <p>I've always been interested in technology and I've always wanted to work with computers. I am extremely happy to have the 
                oppertunity to make this dream a reality through proffessional schooling and on the job co-op experiences. Thoughout elementary 
                school, I was the go to person for technology issues and an avid member of the AV club. This continued on to highschool where
                I yet again made a reputation for myself as a tech guru amoung the teachers and an overall responsible and trustworthy individual.
                In highschool I ammassed over 400 logged community service hours while maintaining an average of mid to high
                90s across all four years. I graduated in 2019 with Principal's honour roll and moved onto an
                undergratuate in a Bachelor of Computing program at the University of Guelph.

            <p>In grade nine I decided I wanted to become a software developer, and imediatly started to teach myself to code. 
                In the four years I was in highschool, I taught myself three programming languages as well as the html and css
                I am using to build this website. Computer Science courses in highschool were trivial and used languages such as
                turing to create programs that were useless in the real world. I was left to myself to learn the industry languages
                that I use in my own projects; Java, Python, and C#. In my final year of highschool, I competed in the java section
                of the Canadian Computing Competitions and finished in the top 25% of all contestants. This earned me a Certificate 
                of Distinction with the Center for Mathematics and Computing at the University of Waterloo. Now in University, I am 
                working to refine my stuctures and usage of the languages to become as knowlageable as I can in my field.
