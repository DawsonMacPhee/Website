            <p>Welcome to my website! I am an Honours Co-op Computer Science major at the University of Guelph and
                this is a collection of projects and information about me and my journey in 
                the technology industry. This site is meant to complement my resume and provide more 
                information and examples of my skills to potential employers. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="subtitle">About Me</h1>
            <p>I've always been interested in technology and I've always wanted to work with computers. I am extremely happy to have the 
                opportunity to make this dream a reality through professional schooling and on the job co-op experiences. Thoughout my entire schooling
                career, I have been a go-to person for technology issues and an overall trustworthy and responsible individual. In highschool alone, I 
                ammassed over 400 logged community service hours by participating in multiple school clubs such as AV and Tech Theatre, while also maintaining 
                an average of mid to high 90s across all four years. 
            </p>
            <p>When I was in grade nine, I decided I wanted to become a software developer, and immediately 
                started to teach myself to code. In the four years I was in highschool, I taught myself three programming languages as well as the HTML and CSS 
                I am using to build this website. In my final year of highschool, I competed in the Java section of the Canadian Computing Competition and finished 
                in the top 25% of all contestants, giving me a Certificate of Distinction with the Center for Mathematics and Computing from the University of 
                Waterloo. I graduated High School in 2019 with Principal's Honour Roll and moved on to my undergraduate studies.

            <p>Now that I'm in University, I am working to refine my structures and usage of the languages I know to become as knowledgeable as I can in my field.
                In my first year, I joined and became an avid member of the Society of Computer Science (SOCIS) and Guelph Coding Community (GCC). I worked 
                hard in all of my classes, declared a minor in Music, and acheived a GPA of 89.6%. I was also invited to be one of 10 undergrad students in my program to 
                compete on the CSGames 2020 junior team. Due to COVID-19 the competition has been delayed, but sometime next year I will compete against many other 
                Computer Science students from across Canada in events such as Relay Programming, Extreme Programming, and Mobile Developement. I am looking forward to
                continuing my schooling this year and working toward becoming a Teaching Assistant in my program.
