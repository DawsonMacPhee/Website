                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, and is meant to be used while coding in
                                    Java. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                    That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Since
                                    its creation, I have continuously added to the program and still update it to this day.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is equivalent to the Java Handbook, but for Python. 
                                    I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on syntax and modules. The 
                                    Python Handbook is in it's infancy stages; there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable 
                                    with the Python Language.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This website was created out of boredom from being finished exams and 
                                    realizing that I had nothing to do. I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself. In trying to find something to create that was different from 
                                    other projects I've done, I realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that I wasn't doing 
                                    anything with. I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website is the result. </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">LAN TicTacToe is a minigame I created in Java that features multiplayer hosting and connecting via
                                    the Java Socket Server class. This program was my first dive into simple networking. The app allows the user to host a game or connect 
                                    to one as a client over a Local Area Network. After opening a socket with which to communicate, the client and host will essentially
                                    send and receive messeages that dictate every move made on the gameboard. Once someone wins, the entire board is reset for rematches.
                                </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This app is mainly built using the JSwing and ServerSocket classes. JSwing displays the 
                                    visiual GUI components, while the socket server communicates information between host and client. A gameloop manages the updating
                                    of the JSwing components, while the servers are handled by threading for efficiency. The communication between host and client is 
                                    handled exactly as though this were an instant messaging app. Whenever a player places an x or an o, a message is sent to the opponent
                                    that tells them what square was selected. Whenever a new x or o is placed, the game checks for a winner by comparing what is written
                                    on each square.
                                </p>
