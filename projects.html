                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, and is meant to be used while coding in
                                    Java. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                    That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Since
                                    its creation, I have continuously added to the program and still update it to this day.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The app is, of course, programmed with Java. Java is my most confident programming 
                                        language and this app has been a really good learning experience for me. It's creation offered me 
                                        valuable practise with JSwing GUI components. In addition to Java, this app also gave me my first experience 
                                        with HTML. The text displayed is styled with HTML within a JEditorPane. This is definetly one of 
                                        my most used and most useful apps.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is equivalent to the Java Handbook, but for Python. 
                                    I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on syntax and modules. The 
                                    Python Handbook is in it's infancy stages; there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable 
                                    with the Python Language.
                                </p>

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is coded in Python, using primarily the Tkinter module, with a
                                        little of the extended ttk module worked in. When Python was a fairly new language to me, I started by learning basic
                                        syntax, then immediatly begun the process of creating the handbook to log my progress. The version included below
                                        is new and refreshed as of August 2019. I restarted from scratch after realising that I could restructure the original 
                                        to make it easier to read and maintain. Currently, the only inlcuded modules are Tkinter and layout managing information, 
                                        however I'm working to add other modules I use often, such as Raspberry Pi GPIO and Socket Servers.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This website was created out of boredom from being finished exams and 
                                    realizing that I had nothing to do. I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself. In trying to find something to create that was different from 
                                    other projects I've done, I realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that I wasn't doing 
                                    anything with. I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website is the result.

                                        Before this website, I had a very rudementary knowledge of HTML from creating The Java Handbook. Yet, that was just extremely simple bolding, 
                                        font size, and emphasis tags. During the planning of this website, I made it my mission to learn not only more about HTML, 
                                        but to also learn CSS and JavaScript to make things look more aesthetically pleasing. I could not be happier with the results. I bought 
                                        the domain in 2018 and being the perfectionist I am, I rebuilt the entire thing from the ground up in 2019 as I learned more
                                        advanced stylings in the markup languages. The site is hosted through GH Pages on GitHub, and the sourcefiles can be viewed there.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">During the 2020 Fall semester, I took a course called Data Structures which explored many different ways 
                                    of storing data within programming langauges. For the final project of this course, we were asked to make use of the structures we had disscussed 
                                    in order to created a statistical AI that can play TicTacToe. I really enjoyed the content we learned, and at the end of the semester, I had acheived a 100% 
                                    averge in the course.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This program is written entirely in C, with the testing files having been written by my proffessor, and the AI functions and implementation 
                                        written by me. I generated all possible varients of a tictactoe board, and made use of a tree structure to store them (by linking the possible moves available from each board). 
                                        From there, I worked through each board and assigned a score for all x's turns and o's turns. When playing the game, the AI will generate the scores and use them to 
                                        select which move to make (which board to branch to). This AI is very effective, and in my testing appears to be unbeatable.
