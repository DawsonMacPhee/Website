                                    publication, currently under development by the British Royal Museum in London England. It is a tool that the LINCS project
                                    has been working on expanding and modifying to meet its specific requirements. I have been one of the main developers working on 
                                    this project for LINCS, and in doing so have made contributions to the main project repository hosted by the British Royal Museum.
                                </p>
                                <div class="expandCard">
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> The platform is built using Java Springboot for the backend, with a webpacked React App 
                                        frontend. It makes use of Blazegraph Triplestores, LDP Containers, Keycloak SSO, Pac4j Security, Apache Shiro, and a Cantaloupe IIIF 
                                        Image server to drive data persistence, authentication, and dataset visualizations. My contributions to the main repository 
                                        include Keycloak SSO login configuration. This allows platform hosters to configure the platform to accept authentication for user login using 
                                        the Keycloak SSO that other LINCS tools use. I also designed a timeline visualization component and implemented platform-wide multilingualization using 
                                        standard i18n tags. My contributions to the LINCS repository are mainly UX and cosmetic changes.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The NERVE Secure and Scalable Infrastructure (NSSI) is a web api for managing the data conversion workflows used by tools and apps 
                                    developed by LINCS. NSSI is modularized, and built to be configurable to support multiple data conversion services all accessible from one convenient 
                                    endpoint. Essentially, NSSI is all about the organization, scalability, and queueing of large data processing tasks. Upon receiving a request, the service is responsible 
                                    for dispatching the data to the correct service queue, loading the data into the system, and setting up a uri from which the processed data can be accessed from.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> NSSI is built off Java Springboot, with Keycloak SSO security, and a RabbitMQ queueing system. The scalability comes from 
                                        a special Kubernetes deployment setup, allowing us to scale the number of instances of each service to meet its individual demand. My contributions to NSSI include 
                                        setting up a standardized JSON logging system for easy debugging, creating a calculation for estimating the time to completion for a job, and creating 
                                        a push notification system to inform users when their jobs have finished.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">At the start of my second year of university, I started working with a friend of mine on a plugin for 
                                    one of our favourite games; Minecraft. We decided we would make use of the Java Spigot API to build a plugin for a minigame to be 
                                    run on a public server. The game is a recreation of an old minigame that I used to play a lot when I was younger. The plugin turned 
                                    out to be a lot more complex than we orginially thought it would be, but works very well and is currently being hosted on our 
                                    own public server.
                                </p>
                                <div class="expandCard">
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The plugin was written in Java and used multiple APIs; most notably of which is the Spigot API 
                                        which is what we used to interface with Minecraft in order to alter the game's function. The other APIs we used were extensions of Spigot
                                        allowing us to further modify the game mechanics. We had to learn how to use these APIs 
                                        as neither of us had used them before. The project is organized and built using Maven with versioning and merges between the 
                                        two of us handled by GitHub. The source files are available for viewing on my friend's GitHub; Ethan Gervais.

                                    and built a mobile minigame. I was responsible for the coding and my friend created the graphics. We ended up building a simple 2d side-scroller
                                    about guiding a spaceship through a maze; it's called Cosmic Crash. The game includes a realistic physics engine as well as integrated ad slots.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This game was created using the Unity Engine and their C# scripting API. The Unity Engine was used to handle level design 
                                        while Unity scripts built in C# are used to add function to the game environment. The ads are handled through Unity's own ads service and are controlled 
                                        via more C# scripts. Since it's built in Unity, it can be published on both IOS and Android platforms. Our early testing has been exclusively in IOS, giving 
                                        me experience in using XCode and testing applications on Apple products.

                                    that the LINCS project has chosen to use across all of its tools and services. The point of this script is to provide administrators the ability to easily configure the 
                                    service across all development environments and all projects that require authentication.

                                        which are what the TUI is responsible for generating based on a predefined set of questions that are prompted by the interface. This allows us to ensure some 
                                        amount of standardization across multiple apps that access this authentication provider. Following the generation of these JSON files, they are deployed via a 
                                        simple HTTP request made to the service.

                                    realizing that I had nothing to do. I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself. In trying to find something to create that was different from 
                                    other projects I've done, I realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that I wasn't doing 
                                    anything with. I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website is the result.

                                        Before this website, I had a very rudementary knowledge of HTML from creating The Java Handbook. Yet, that was just extremely simple bolding, 
                                        font size, and emphasis tags. During the planning of this website, I made it my mission to learn not only more about HTML, 
                                        but to also learn CSS and JavaScript to make things look more aesthetically pleasing. I could not be happier with the results. I bought 
                                        the domain in 2018 and being the perfectionist I am, I rebuilt the entire thing from the ground up in 2019 as I learned more
                                        advanced stylings in the markup languages. The site is hosted through GH Pages on GitHub, and the sourcefiles can be viewed there.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">During the 2020 Fall semester, I took a course called Data Structures which explored many different ways 
                                    of storing data within programming languages. For the final project of this course, we were asked to make use of the structures we had discussed 
                                    in order to create a statistical AI that can play TicTacToe. I really enjoyed the content we learned, and at the end of the semester, I had acheived a 100% 
                                    average in the course.

                                        written by me. I generated all possible variants of a tictactoe board, and made use of a tree structure to store them (by linking the possible moves available from each board). 
                                        From there, I worked through each board and assigned a score for all of x's turns and o's turns. When playing the game, the AI will generate the scores and use them to 
                                        select which move to make (which board to branch to). This AI is very effective, and in my testing appears to be unbeatable.

                                    from the IMDB movie database. These hashtables were then used to create a series of searching functions relating to actors and movies. The programs take input from a specific 
                                    file format created by my professor and generate hashtable files that match keys and values for faster references.

                                        on the generated files. Internally, each actor and movie is assigned a key value and the keys are mapped to each other which creates connections between actors 
                                        and the movies they appeared in.

                                    library of functions for manipulating a specific data structure. During the 5 assignments in the course, we covered pointer/byte/bit manipulation, arrays, linked lists, trees, 
                                    and hashtables. The test files included were written by my professor, but the functions within the libraries were written by myself.

                                        are actually quite useful in the programming of C applications. Each library contains functions for creation, deletion, adding/removing elements, sorting elements, and

                                    function of the extension is to act as a webpage scanner for information related to the datasets of LINCS' research partners. After opening the extension on a 
                                    website, the entire content of the site is run through an NER algorithm, the results of which are then queried against the LINCS triplestore. After this, the 
                                    related information is displayed inline in the website content, with links provided that connect out to other LINCS tools.

                                        for LINCS, with my employers giving me a list of requirements and allowing me the freedom to build the extension from the ground up. Later on in the development 
                                        cycle, I worked directly with the UX team for the project to develop and implement an interface that is visually appealing and functional.

                                    of a Chrome extension that allows users to navigate through pages while creating highlighter templates. Highlighter templates are one of the most commonly used 
                                    services at Schema App. Using XPaths, these templates allow you to create generalized markup for a webpage and then quickly deploy the created markup on potentially 
                                    millions of similar webpages. The markup itself is generated via the template every time the page loads, so it's always up to date. I worked solely on frontend

                                        directly with the monolithic Laravel PHP app that already exists for the Schema App and Schema Admin App tools. Through this project, I learned a lot about 
                                        the creation of extensions and Vue. In my first Chrome Extension, The Lincs Browser Extension, I was given free rein to build as I decided to. Now that I have 
                                        a professionally built extension to compare it to, I can identify areas of the extension that I would have built very differently. The other really interesting 
                                        aspect of this project was learning about the suite of dev tools that have been created solely for the dev team to use. These are parts of the app that are hidden 
                                        from the normal user and exist solely to increase development and decrease debugging time.

                                    to mint new URIs. This webservice is responsible for the creation of these URIs according to LINCS specifications. Considering the amount of universally unique identifiers we need, it 
                                    made the most sense to create a service that would do it for us and allow us to standardize the lengths and characters used. This service also prevents the rare case of 
                                    overlapping two different resources with the same URI.

                                        Node.JS, with a library called NanoID for UUID generation, and a Postgres database for storing UUIDs that have already been generated. This project gave me my first experience

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Linked Open Data Visualization (Lod Viz), is another project I worked on for the LINCS project. This is 
                                    a visualization of linked open data that was originally designed by the Urban Complexity Lab (UCLAB) in Germany. The original version
                                    of this tool ran off csv data, instead of lod as it's meant to. My contribution to the project was to create a form to generate true lod, 
                                    create an admin page for vetting the form data, and then modifying the visualization to run off the generated data.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> Lod Viz is a PHP application, and for my modifications I had to learn the language. I used a Postgres 
                                        database to hold form submissions, basic auth for an admin page, Vue.js for UX components, a PHP library called EasyRdf to generate 
                                        the lod, and an Apache Fuseki triplestore to hold the generated data. After finishing my changes, I created a Python script with the 
                                        Pandas and Rdflib modules to translate the existing csv formatted data into lod.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Through this interface subscribers of Schema App are able to configure their markup and deployment methods. There 
                                    are many ways of generating markup, including a manual data creation editor for static pages, a web crawler that can go through sites to apply 
                                    daily updates to markup, templates that can generate markup on page load, and in some cases the app is even able to pull information directly 
                                    from third-party applications that the subscriber already uses. For deployment, users can configure integrations with services such as Shopify, 
                                    Big Commerce, WordPress, and other third-party tools. This is a massive repository built in monolithic Laravel PHP and Vue with Bootstrap 
                                    components. My contributions include a variety of bug fixes and UX improvements.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> Coming into this project, I had minimal experience in PHP. Coming out of this project, I had used PHP in almost 
                                        everything I'd done for 4 months. It was a fantastic learning experience. Originally, I had a number of negative thoughts about PHP. I had a 
                                        belief that it was old, outdated, and wasn't worth learning. In reality, I have come to enjoy the language a fair bit. The experience I 
                                        previously had with EasyRdf turned out to be very useful, as Schema App used a modified version of the same library to build an API called 
                                        GraphWrangler that further simplifies the interaction between RDF data and pragmatically accessing information. The main data source of the 
                                        app is Amazon's Neptune triplestore, which as it turns out is incredibly similar to a triplestore I've used before called Blazegraph. It was 
                                        even developed by the same group of people. Working on this project was great for expanding my knowledge of technologies that I've already used.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Schema Admin app is the administrative side of Schema App's main platform. This is the place that Customer Success 
                                    Managers and Operational Managers are able to access client accounts to configure their markup, set up enterprise contract deals, make administrative 
                                    changes to a customer's account, and access metrics, customer information and more. This app essentially contains everything that has been decided 
                                    as needing manual administrative configuration. This is where most of the Customer Insights Engine team does their work. During my time on this 
                                    project I made a variety of UX improvements and bug fixes, primarily around the customer info reports system and the data editor.

                                        Vue with Bootstrap approach. By packaging them in the same repo, the company was able to reuse a lot of foundational components and increase the 
                                        development speed for the two apps since modifying one component affects both apps. There are some new components in the admin app however, including 
                                        some really cool datacentric models around developing data reports and modifying data entry forms. The admin app is where I was able to practice 
                                        my SPARQL and RDF knowledge.
