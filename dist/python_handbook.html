                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, written in Java, to be used for 
                                Java coding. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Over
                                the past four years, I have continuously added to the program and continue to update it to this day.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is the exact same as The Java Handbook, but is built in Python,
                                    to be used during Python coding. I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on 
                                    syntax and modules. The Python Handbook is still in it's infancy stages and is fairly new. I begun working on it
                                    in 2017, and there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable with the Python Language.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is coded in Python, using primarily the Tkinter module, with a
                                    little of the extended ttk module worked in. When Python was a fairly new language to me, I started by learning basic
                                    syntax, then immediatly begun the process of creating the handbook to log my progress. The version included below
                                    is new and refreshed as of August 2019. I restarted from scratch
                                    after realising that I could restructure the original to make it easier to read and maintain. Currently, the only inlcuded 
                                    modules are Tkinter and layout managing information, however I'm working to add other commonly used modules, such as Raspberry Pi GPIO 
                                    and Socket Servers.
