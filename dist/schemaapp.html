            <h1 class="subtitle">Schema App</h1>
            <p>Schema App is a digital marketing company focussing on search engine optimization using schema markup techniques. Some 
                search engines make use of linked data formatted in the schema ontology to give context to websites, and by doing so direct traffic and provide rich 
                search results more efficiently. Schema App is an industry leader in the creation and maitenence of this markup through a suite of tools they've 
                designed in house to accomplish this task. Schema App works directly with companies wishing to increase their online presense in both a software 
                as a service and a traditional service model. I worked with Schema App for 4 months and have aceepted an invitation to join them for another 8 months 
                in my next placement.</p>

            <p>Schema App provided me with a great co-op experience. I was accepted onto to team just as any full time developer would be, and made many 
                connections while also learning a lot about many new technologies. Developement at Schema App is split into a couple different teams, 
                and I had the pleasure of working on two of them during my placement which gave me a great overview of the buisness. The first was the 
                Highlighter Chrome Extension team, where I focused purely on front-end component design, implemenetation, and bug fixing. I worked directly 
                with a senior dev mentor and learned a lot about attention to detail, front-end best practises, and brushed up on my knowlege of Vue and Bootstrap. 
                The second was the Customer Insights Engine team, where I focussed on rdf data models, designing both front-end and back-end components with 
                datacentric principals in mind, and brushing up on my knowledge of PHP, Vue, Bootstrap, and SPARQL. Again, I worked directly with a senior dev 
                mentor and learned a lot about infastructure, and what it means to design a datacentric application. Working on these two teams meant working 
                on the two projects that make up most of Schema App's service, you can learn more about them below...

            <p>The main goal of having a Co-op placement is to gain experience in your field as a student, so you're not as green when you graduate 
                and enter the real job market. Being in a Co-op program means you are required to set more specific goals to meet during 
                a placement. My goals at Schema App were to learn about Amazon Web Services, make connections by meeting with all coworkers,
                and complete all my assigned Objective Key Results within their due dates. I believe that I've accomplished all of these goals 
                and the outstanding feedback I've received from my employer corroberates this belief. For learning AWS pracises, I participated 
                in weekly bookclub meetings, where we read a book on AWS Serverless design. I also learned how to and practised the use of SAM configurations to set 
                up a CodeBuild pipeline for a service. For connecting with co-workers I was successful and had a coffee chat with all 30ish employees in 
                the office. It was really rewarding to meet with a group of very smart people who are all passionate about their work, and it also 
                helped to make me feel much more connected with departments of the buisness that developers don't usually interact with. For completing 
                all my OKRs on time, I practised my time management skills and easily managed to cover and exceed my ticket quotas. I am very thankful to 
                the entire team at Schema App and am looking forward to returning to them for another 8 months of work soon.
