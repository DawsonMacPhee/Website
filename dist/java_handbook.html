                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, written in Java, to be used for 
                                    Java coding. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                    That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Over
                                    the past four years, I have continuously added to the program and continue to update it to this day.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The app is, of course, programmed with Java. Java is my most confident programming 
                                    language and this app has actually been a really good learning experience for me. It's creation offered me 
                                    valuable practise with JSwing GUI components. In addition to Java, this app also gave me my first experience 
                                    with HTML and CSS. The text displayed is styled with HTML and CSS within a JEditorPane. This is definetly one of 
                                    my most used and most useful apps. Whenever I program in Java, I find it very helpful to have this app open to 
                                    reference syntax whenever I need to. At this point, I know enough programming languages that after a while, I 
                                    can forget the exact syntax of a specific function. This negates that problem.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is the exact same as The Java Handbook, but is built in Python,
                                    to be used during Python coding. I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on 
                                    syntax and modules. The Python Handbook is still in it's infancy stages and is fairly new. I begun working on it
                                    in August 2019, and there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable with the Python Language.</p>
