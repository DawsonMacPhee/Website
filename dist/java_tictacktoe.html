                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, written in Java, to be used for 
                                Java coding. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Over
                                the past four years, I have continuously added to the program and continue to update it to this day.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is the exact same as The Java Handbook, but is built in Python,
                                    to be used during Python coding. I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on 
                                    syntax and modules. The Python Handbook is still in it's infancy stages and is fairly new. I begun working on it
                                    in August 2019, and there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable with the Python Language.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This website came to be out of boredom from being finished exams and 
                                    realizing that I had no work to do at all.  So, I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself.  In trying to find something to create that was different and new, I 
                                    realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that weren't doing anything or going anywhere.
                                    I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website here is the result.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">LAN TicTackToe is a minigame I created in Java that features multiplayer hosting and connecting via
                                the Java Socket Server class. This program was my first dive into simple networking. The app allows the user to host a game or connect 
                                to one as a client over a Local Area Network. After opening a socket with which to communicate, the client and host will essentially
                                send and receive messeages that dictate every move made on the gameboard. Once someone wins, the entire board is reset for rematches.
                                </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This app is mainly built using the JSwing and ServerSocket classes. JSwing displays the 
                                    visiual GUI components, while the socket server communicates information between host and client. A gameloop manages the updating
                                    of the JSwing components, while the servers are handled by threading for efficiency. The communication between host and client is 
                                    handled exactly as though this were an instant messaging app. Whenever a player places an x or an o, a message is sent to the opponent
                                    that tells them what square was selected. Whenever a new x or o is placed, the game checks for a winner by comparing what is written
                                    on each square.
                                </p>
