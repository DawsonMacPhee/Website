                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, written in Java, to be used for 
                                Java coding. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a function. Over
                                the past four years, I have continuously added to the program and continue to update it to this day.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is the exact same as The Java Handbook, but is built in Python,
                                    to be used during Python coding. I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on 
                                    syntax and modules. The Python Handbook is still in it's infancy stages and is fairly new. I begun working on it
                                    in August 2019, and there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable with the Python Language.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This website came to be out of boredom from being finished exams and 
                                    realizing that I had no work to do at all.  So, I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself.  In trying to find something to create that was different and new, I 
                                    realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that weren't doing anything or going anywhere.
                                    I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website here is the result. </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This website in it's entirety is built and styled using HTML and CSS. Before this wesite, 
                                    I had a very rudementary knowledge of HTML from creating The Java Handbook. Yet, that was just extremely simple bolding, 
                                    font size, and emphasis tags. During the planning of this website, I made it my mission to learn not only more about HTML, 
                                    but to also learn CSS to make things look more astetically pleasing. I could not be happier with the results. I bought 
                                    the domain in 2018 and being the perfectionist I am, I rebuilt the entire thing from the ground up in 2019 as I learned more
                                    advanced stylings in the markup language. The site is hosted through GH Pages on github, and the sourcefiles can be viewed there.
